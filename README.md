# Java-RightAnagled_Triangale_Patterns
This Java program prints a right-angled triangle pattern using asterisks. It initializes star to 1 and iterates through a loop 4 times (i = 0 to 3). Inside, a nested loop prints star number of asterisks (*), increasing star by 1 after each row. The output forms a right-angled triangle of height 4.
